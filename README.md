## Model optimisation

### Model 1
The training results indicate that the model is performing well, with loss dropping from 0.65 to 0.3 and accuracy increasing from 0.75 to 0.9. The fact that training stopped early (after 12 epochs) suggests that early stopping was used effectively to prevent overfitting, as indicated by the matching train and validation graphs.
#### Analysis of Current Performance
* **Loss Reduction:** A decrease in loss from 0.65 to 0.3 is a substantial improvement.
* **Accuracy Improvement:** An accuracy increase from 0.75 to 0.9 is quite significant.
* **Early Stopping:** The model stopped training early, indicating that it reached a point where further training did not yield significant improvements on the validation set.
* **No Overfitting/Underfitting:** The alignment of training and validation graphs suggests that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
